# learning-materials
A melting pot of Python scripts I found useful for referencing as I learn.
Credit for scripts goes to the following YouTube channels:
    - sentdex
    - Corey Schafer
    - Max Goodridge
    - Trevor Payne

Line 1 of each script moving forward from today (7/4/18) should be crediting the appropriate author

I need to go back and inserting some credits for the legacy scripts.
