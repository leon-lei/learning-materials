# learning-materials
A melting pot of Python scripts I found useful for referencing as I learn.
Credit for scripts goes to:
    - sentdex (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ)
    - Corey Schafer (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g)
    - Max Goodridge (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAx4nmhI7S1RcPiaG-Uw0tg)
    - Trevor Payne (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPme28sMOcWS50CgtTWUZIw)

Line 1 of each script moving forward from today (7/4/18) should be crediting the appropriate author

I need to go back and inserting some credits for the legacy scripts.
